    <h3>Hideki Kamiya's first action game, one that would change all the rules.</h3>
      <p>The game began its development as the earliest version of <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, but Kamiya gradually convinced the team to turn it into a separate project.</p>
      <p>A lightning-quick and challenging action game that pushed style and player self-expression to the forefront.</p>
