    <h3 class="subheader">Hideki Kamiya's first action game, one that would change all the rules.</h3>
      <p>The game began its development as the earliest version of <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, but Kamiya gradually convinced the team to turn it into a separate project.</p>
      <p>A lightning-quick and challenging action game that pushed style and player self-expression to the forefront.</p>

          <li>Despite the game's tremendous financial and critical success, Kamiya and Team Little Devils were not brought on to develop the ill-fated <em>Devil May Cry 2</em>.</li>
